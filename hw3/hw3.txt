2 - What happens if another broker goes down ?
The zookeeper server needs to have at least three brockers UP to run correctly. So we will have an error.

We need to have 3 brokers minimum, so 2 brokers down isn't a problem.


4 - What if you changed the replcation factor for your topic ?
The replication factor allows you to configure the minimum number of UP servers that you need to work.
